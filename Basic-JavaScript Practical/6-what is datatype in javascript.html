<!-- what is datatype in javascript ?

Ans:- In JavaScript, data types specify the nature of data that a variable can hold. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables are not bound to a particular data type; instead, their data type can change during the execution of a program.

Types of datatype in javascript:

1. primitive datatype:
   1. Number
   2. String
   3. Undefined
   4. Boolean
   5. Null
   6. BigInt
   7. Symbol
   8. NaN

2. Non-Primitive datatype:
   1. Object
   2. Array
